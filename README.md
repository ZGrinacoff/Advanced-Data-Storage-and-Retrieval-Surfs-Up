Climate Analysis: Honolulu, HI

- This project investigates expected weather for a trip to Hawaii in July-August 2019. 

- I modeled and analyzed fictional weather data for Hawaii, collected at various weather stations, to predict typical weather during said trip within climate_analysis.ipynb. 

- Then developed an API that allows data calls from a SQLite database using SQLAlchemy and Flask.

- Utilize Python and SQLAlchemy to do basic climate analysis and data exploration of the climate database. All of the following analysis is 		completed using SQLAlchemy ORM queries, Pandas, and Matplotlib.

- Utilizes VSCode to create Flask API for queries developed in this notebook. (Please refer to app.py for code and additional information.)

Resources:

- hawaii.sqlite: Utilized throughout project via SQLAlchemy and includes all data from both csv documents listed below.

- hawaii_measurements.csv

- hawaii_stations.csv

Images:

- Includes 4 total .png files created via Matplotlib within the Jupyter Notebook.

  - temperature_histogram.png
  - trip_avg_temp.png
  - daily_normals.png
