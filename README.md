To Do:
Complete Flask App
Complete additional analysis in notebook

Questions:
Why am I able to run app in VSCode terminal but not in gitbash?
Why am I unable to navigate to certain api calls from home window? AKA I need to restart API call each time...

For stations api call: Is it asking for same query from notebook code, or a list of all stations only, or all data for all stations listed?

For tobs api call: Are we supposed to return only for the most active station, or for all stations?
